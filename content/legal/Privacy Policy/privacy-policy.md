# DesignRant's Privacy Policy

Please read the following information carefully before accessing or using DesignRant.

## English, NOT Legalese

Most website terms, conditions and privacy policies are unreadable and verbose. These documents are almost always written by and for lawyers, and in our opinion, they are ineffective.

DesignRant is built for it's authors first and so because we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our contributors and consumers, we have decided to use plain English where possible, to make our terms as clear as they can be for a better User Experience.

Please also don't forget that we're all real people. Take a look at our profiles on the author page and get to know us. We are not perfect, but we're trying, and we genuinly care about creating better user experiences on this site and across the web.

## Amendments to this document

We cannot make amendments to this document for any particular user. However, if the changes that you suggest could apply to all of our users and we believe the change appropriate, we will be happy to update it for everyone.

Improvements can and will be made to this document over time without notice. By continuing to use this site, you implicitly accept any future changes we make to it.

Your access and use of [http://designrant.app/](http://designrant.app/) is always subject to the most current version of this document.

## Fundamental Principles

Your privacy is very important to us.

At DesignRant we follow the following fundamental principles:
- We don't ask for or use any personal information unless we truly need it.
- Everyone hates those services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no reason whatsoever but collecting data.
- We do not share your personal information with anyone except if necessary to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
- We do not store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.

The following section is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.

The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors of DesignRant choose to interact with it in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at designrant.app to provide a name and email address. DesignRant collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with DesignRant.

DesignRant does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors may refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging with certain features of DesignRant.
