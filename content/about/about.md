# Design Rant

We all try to remain positive people but occassionally we need to complain. This site is a place to vent about some of the user interfaces and experiences that drive us all insane.

I ‘d like to point out that while we can be quite negative here, we also think that there are plenty of examples out there where people have built awesome, friendly and beautiful user interfaces. Perhaps in the future we will build a site dedicated to these too.

#### Get Noticed

DesignRant puts the Authors first. DesignRant has no ads or sponsors so we cannot pay you for your content, but we can help you get exposure. We actively encourage cross posting as we understand your reach is important. 

Each writer has a dedicated page that is linked to wherever your content is.  The author page is for you, the link to your personal site and your sponsorship pages are the only primary call to actions. We currently have support for your twitter handle, personal site link, ko-fi and buymeacoffee with more coming soon. We are also open to suggestions on what we should add to author profiles.

The whole site is built using our favourite react framework - Gatsby! If you haven't heard of it, you should check it out.
